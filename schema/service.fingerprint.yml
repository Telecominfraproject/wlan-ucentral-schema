  This section can be used to configure device fingerprinting.
type: object
properties:
  mode:
    description: |
      Fingerprint collection and reporting mode. Controls how device fingerprint
      data is processed and when it is reported to the management system.
      - "polled": Fingerprints are collected when requested by the management system
      - "final": Fingerprints are reported after analysis is complete (recommended)
      - "raw-data": Raw fingerprint data is sent immediately without processing
    type: string
    enum:
    - polled
    - final
    - raw-data
    default: final
  minimum-age:
    description: |
      Minimum age in seconds that a device fingerprint must have before it is
      reported to the management system. This prevents reporting of transient
      or incomplete fingerprints. Example: With value 60, only fingerprints
      that have been stable for at least 60 seconds are reported.
    type: number
    default: 60
  maximum-age:
    description: |
      Maximum age in seconds after which device fingerprints are removed from
      local storage. This prevents memory buildup by cleaning up old fingerprint
      data. Example: With value 3600, fingerprints older than 1 hour are
      automatically deleted from local cache.
    type: number
    default: 60
  periodicity:
    description: |
      Reporting interval in seconds that defines how often fingerprint data is
      sent to the management system. This controls the frequency of batch
      reporting to balance network efficiency with data freshness.
      Example: With value 600, fingerprint reports are sent every 10 minutes.
    type: number
    default: 600
  allow-wan:
    description: |
      Enable fingerprinting of devices connected to WAN ports. When enabled,
      the system will analyze and report fingerprints for devices detected on
      upstream network interfaces. This is typically disabled for privacy and
      security reasons as WAN devices are usually outside the local network.
    type: boolean
    default: false
