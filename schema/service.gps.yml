  Configure GPS dongle functionality for location services and time synchronization.
  This service enables the system to receive GPS coordinates and optionally synchronize 
  the system clock with GPS time. Requires a compatible GPS dongle connected via serial.

  adjust-time:
    description: |
      Enable automatic system clock synchronization when GPS achieves a valid position fix.
      When enabled, the system will update its internal clock to match GPS time, providing
      accurate timekeeping even without internet connectivity. This is useful for precise
      timing requirements or when NTP servers are unavailable.
    type: boolean
    default: false
  baud-rate:
    description: |
      Serial communication baud rate for the GPS dongle. Must match the baud rate
      configured on the GPS device to establish proper communication. Common rates
      vary by GPS module manufacturer - consult device documentation for supported
      rates. Most consumer GPS modules default to 9600 baud.
      Example: For u-blox modules, 9600 is typical; for some SiRF modules, 4800 is common.
    type: integer
    enum:
    - 2400
    - 4800
