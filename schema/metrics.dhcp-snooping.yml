  DHCP snooping metrics configuration for monitoring DHCP traffic on bridged interfaces.
  This enables capturing and reporting DHCP message exchanges on interfaces where
  the access point acts as a bridge rather than providing DHCP services directly.
  DHCP snooping provides visibility into client IP address assignments, DHCP server
  interactions, and network behavior for troubleshooting and monitoring purposes.

      List of DHCP message types to capture and report to the backend for monitoring.
      When specified, only the selected message types will be reported. If empty or
      omitted, all DHCP traffic will be captured (equivalent to wildcard '*' filter).
      
      Message types correspond to different phases of DHCP operations:
      - 'discover': Client broadcasts to find available DHCP servers
      - 'offer': DHCP server responds with IP address offer
      - 'request': Client requests specific IP address from server
      - 'ack': Server confirms IP address assignment
      - 'solicit': DHCPv6 client initiates address request
      - 'reply': DHCPv6 server responds with configuration
      - 'renew': Client requests lease renewal
      
      Example: Use ['ack', 'discover'] to monitor only successful assignments and client requests.
