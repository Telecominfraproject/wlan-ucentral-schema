  Configuration for device-to-cloud connection timeouts and retry behavior.
  These settings control how the device handles loss of connectivity to the
  management cloud and its recovery mechanisms.
type: object
properties:
  offline:
    description: |
      Maximum duration (in seconds) the device can remain disconnected from the cloud
      before transitioning to orphan state. During this offline period, the device
      continues normal operation using its last known configuration. Once this timeout
      expires, the device enters orphan mode and begins active cloud discovery.
      A longer timeout reduces unnecessary discovery attempts during temporary outages.
      Example: 3600 (1 hour) allows for brief network maintenance without triggering orphan mode.
    type: integer
    examples:
    - 3600
    - 7200
  orphan:
    description: |
      Retry interval (in seconds) for cloud discovery attempts when the device is in
      orphan state. After losing cloud connectivity beyond the offline timeout, the
      device periodically attempts to re-establish connection at this interval.
      Shorter intervals provide faster recovery but increase network traffic and CPU usage.
      Example: 120 (2 minutes) balances quick recovery with resource efficiency.
    type: integer
    examples:
    - 60
    - 120
    - 300
  validate:
    description: |
      Grace period (in seconds) for the device to successfully connect to the cloud
      after discovering it. If connection is not established within this timeout,
      the device restarts the discovery process. This prevents the device from getting
      stuck attempting to connect to an unreachable cloud endpoint.
      Example: 60 (1 minute) provides reasonable time for TLS handshake and authentication.

    - 30
