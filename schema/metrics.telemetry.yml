  Configure unsolicited telemetry streaming for continuous monitoring and 
  analysis. This metric enables bulk collection and forwarding of event data 
  to the cloud at regular intervals, providing continuous visibility into 
  device operations and network behavior. Events are validated against the 
  system's event registry before being configured for streaming.

  interval:
    description: |
      The reporting interval in seconds that controls how frequently telemetry 
      data is collected and transmitted to the cloud. This setting balances 
      monitoring frequency with bandwidth usage and system performance.
      
      Typical values range from 120 seconds (2 minutes) for detailed monitoring 
      to 600 seconds (10 minutes) for standard operational telemetry. The 
      interval should be chosen based on monitoring requirements and network 
      capacity.
    type: integer
    examples: [120, 300, 600, 900]
  types:
    description: |
      Array of event type identifiers to include in the telemetry stream.
      Only event types that exist in the system's event registry (/etc/events.json)
      will be configured - invalid types are silently filtered out.
      
      Event types represent different categories of operational data:
      - client.associate, client.disassociate: WiFi client connection events
      - wifi.start, wifi.stop: WiFi interface state changes
      - dhcp.ack, dhcp.discover: DHCP transaction events  
      - dns.query: DNS lookup events
      - Various system and network operational events
      
      The telemetry stream aggregates these events for bulk transmission,
      unlike realtime metrics which forward events immediately.
    type: array
    items:
      type: string
      examples:
        - "client.associate"
        - "wifi.start" 
        - "dhcp.ack"
        - "dns.query"
