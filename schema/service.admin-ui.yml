  wifi-ssid:
    description: |
      The SSID (network name) for the administrative WiFi interface. This creates
      a special recovery network that allows device access even when the main
      configuration has issues. The interface will be created with a static IP
      (10.254.254.1/24) and basic services (SSH, HTTP) enabled.
      Example: "Admin-Network" or "Recovery-WiFi"
    type: string
    default: Maverick
    maxLength: 32
    minLength: 1
  wifi-key:
    description: |
      The Pre Shared Key (PSK) used for WPA2 encryption on the admin interface.
      If not specified, the network will be open (no encryption). When set, the
      admin WiFi network will use WPA2-PSK security. Must be between 8-63 characters.
      Example: "SecureAdminPassword123"
    type: string
    maxLength: 63
    minLength: 8
  wifi-bands:
    description: |
      The radio bands on which the admin SSID should be broadcast. The system will
      use the first available matching band from the list. If not specified, defaults
      to both 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands for maximum compatibility.
      Example: ["5G"] for 5GHz-only operation, or ["2G", "5G"] for dual-band
    type: array
    items:
      type: string
      enum:
      - 2G
      - 5G
      - 5G-lower
      - 5G-upper
      - 6G
      - HaLow
  offline-trigger:
    description: |
      The time threshold (in seconds) that triggers automatic admin UI activation
      when the device loses connectivity. When the device is offline for longer than
      this duration, the admin interface will automatically become available to allow
      local recovery access. This helps recover devices that have lost remote management.
      Example: 300 for 5 minutes, 3600 for 1 hour
    type: number
