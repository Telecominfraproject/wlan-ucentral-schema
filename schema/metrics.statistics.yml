  Configure periodic statistics collection and reporting. This metric enables 
  monitoring of various system subsystems and network components through regular 
  data collection intervals. Statistics include traffic counters, client 
  associations, neighbor information, and other operational metrics that help 
  track system health and performance.
type: object
properties:
  interval:
    description: |
      The reporting interval in seconds that defines how frequently statistics 
      are collected and reported. This controls the balance between monitoring 
      granularity and system resource usage.
      
      Minimum value is 60 seconds to prevent excessive system load. Common 
      values are 300 seconds (5 minutes) for regular monitoring or 120 seconds 
      (2 minutes) for more detailed tracking.
    type: integer
    minimum: 60
    examples: [120, 300, 600]

    description: |
      Array of subsystem types to monitor and report statistics for. Each type 
      represents a different category of operational data that can be collected 
      independently.
      
      Available statistics types:
      - ssids: Wireless network statistics including client counts, traffic 
        volumes, and association metrics per SSID
      - lldp: Link Layer Discovery Protocol information about neighboring 
        network devices and topology
      - clients: Connected client device information including association 
        status, signal strength, and traffic statistics  
      - tid-stats: Traffic Identifier statistics for analyzing different 
        types of network traffic flows and QoS metrics
