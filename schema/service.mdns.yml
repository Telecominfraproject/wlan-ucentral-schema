      Enable the mDNS service on the access point. When enabled, the service will 
      run on all interfaces configured with the 'mdns' service, or on all interfaces 
      if the fingerprint service is also enabled. The service listens on UDP port 5353 
      and requires appropriate firewall rules to function properly.
