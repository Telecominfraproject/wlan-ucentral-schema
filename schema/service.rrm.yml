  beacon-request-assoc:
    description: |
      Request beacon reports from clients when they associate to the access point.
      This enables RRM to gather information about surrounding wireless environment
      from the client's perspective, improving radio optimization decisions.
      Example: Enable to collect neighbor AP information from clients for better
      channel planning and interference analysis.
    type: boolean
    default: true
  station-stats-interval:
    description: |
      Interval in seconds for collecting and reporting station statistics.
      This controls how frequently RRM gathers performance metrics from connected clients
      including signal strength, data rates, and traffic patterns for optimization analysis.
      Set to 0 to disable periodic statistics collection.
      Example: Set to 60 for statistics collection every minute.
