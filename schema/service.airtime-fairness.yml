  This section configures Airtime Fairness (ATF) to manage bandwidth allocation
  between wireless clients. ATF dynamically adjusts client weights based on traffic
  patterns to ensure fair wireless resource distribution and optimize performance.
type: object
properties:
  voice-weight:
    description: |
      Weight multiplier applied to voice traffic for priority calculations.
      Since voice traffic is not aggregated and requires higher priority than video,
      this weight provides additional priority when calculating traffic averages.
      Higher values increase voice traffic priority.
    type: number
    default: 4
  packet-threshold:
    description: |
      Number of packets that must be received for a specific traffic type before
      a new traffic average is calculated. This prevents frequent weight changes
      from small traffic bursts and ensures stable classification decisions.
      Example: With threshold 100, traffic classification updates after every
      100 packets of a specific type are processed.
    type: number
    default: 100
  bulk-threshold:
    description: |
      Percentage threshold for bulk traffic classification. When more than this
      percentage of a client's traffic is identified as bulk (e.g., file downloads,
      backups), the client is assigned the bulk weight to reduce its airtime priority.
      Example: With threshold 50, clients with more than 50% bulk traffic get
      reduced priority to allow other clients better access.
    type: number
    default: 50
  priority-threshold:
    description: |
      Percentage threshold for priority traffic classification. When more than this
      percentage of a client's traffic is identified as priority (e.g., voice, video,
      gaming), the client is assigned the priority weight to increase its airtime access.
      Priority classification takes precedence over bulk classification.
      Example: With threshold 30, clients with more than 30% priority traffic get
      increased airtime allocation.
    type: number
    default: 30
  weight-normal:
    description: |
      Default Airtime Fairness weight assigned to wireless clients (UEs) under
      normal traffic conditions. This is the baseline weight used when clients
      don't meet the thresholds for priority or bulk traffic classification.
      Higher weight values provide more airtime access relative to other clients.
    type: number
    default: 256
  weight-priority:
    description: |
      Enhanced Airtime Fairness weight assigned to wireless clients when priority
      traffic exceeds the configured priority-threshold percentage. This higher weight
      ensures priority applications (voice, video, gaming) receive sufficient airtime
      for optimal performance. Should be higher than weight-normal to provide
      preferential treatment.
    type: number
    default: 394
  weight-bulk:
    description: |
      Reduced Airtime Fairness weight assigned to wireless clients when bulk traffic
      exceeds the configured bulk-threshold percentage. This lower weight limits
      airtime for clients generating heavy background traffic (downloads, backups)
      to prevent them from monopolizing wireless resources. Should be lower than
      weight-normal to ensure fair access for other clients.
    type: number
    default: 128
