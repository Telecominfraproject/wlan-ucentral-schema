  Configure IEEE 802.11 management frame monitoring and reporting. This metric 
  enables selective capture and forwarding of specific WiFi management frame 
  types to the cloud for analysis, troubleshooting, and security monitoring.
  When no filters are specified, all management frames are captured using a 
  wildcard filter.

    description: |
      Array of IEEE 802.11 management frame types to monitor and forward to 
      the backend. Each frame type represents a specific category of wireless 
      management activity that can be captured for analysis.
      
      Available frame types:
      - probe: Probe request/response frames for network discovery
      - auth: Authentication frames during connection establishment
      - assoc: Association request/response frames for client connection
      - disassoc: Disassociation frames when clients disconnect normally
      - deauth: Deauthentication frames for forced disconnections
      - local-deauth: Locally initiated deauthentication events
      - inactive-deauth: Deauthentication due to client inactivity
      - key-mismatch: Authentication failures due to incorrect credentials
      - beacon-report: Beacon report frames for radio environment monitoring
      - radar-detected: Radar detection events affecting channel usage
      - sta-authorized: Station authorization completion events
      - ft-finish: Fast transition (802.11r) completion events
      
      If no filters are specified, all management frames are captured using 
      a wildcard '*' filter. The first specified filter replaces the default 
      configuration, and subsequent filters are added to the list.
