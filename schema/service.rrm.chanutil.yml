  RRM policy configuration for automatic channel optimization based on channel utilization monitoring.
  This policy continuously monitors airtime utilization and triggers channel changes when
  utilization exceeds configured thresholds, helping to maintain optimal wireless performance
  by moving to less congested channels.
type: object
properties:
  interval:
    description: |
      Monitoring interval in seconds for checking channel utilization levels.
      Defines how frequently RRM measures airtime usage on the current channel
      to determine if optimization is needed. Lower values provide more responsive
      optimization but increase system overhead.
      Example: 300 seconds (5 minutes) for balanced monitoring frequency.
    type: number
    minimum: 240
  threshold:
    description: |
      Channel utilization threshold as a percentage (0-99) that triggers optimization.
      When measured airtime utilization exceeds this value for the configured number
      of consecutive checks, RRM will attempt to find and switch to a less congested channel.
      Higher values reduce sensitivity to temporary congestion but may delay necessary
      channel changes. Lower values provide more aggressive optimization.
      Example: 70% threshold provides good balance between stability and responsiveness.
    type: number
    minimum: 0
    maximum: 99
    examples:
    - 50
  consecutive-threshold-breach:
    description: |
      Number of consecutive monitoring intervals where utilization must exceed the threshold
      before triggering channel optimization. This prevents unnecessary channel changes due
      to temporary spikes in utilization and ensures stable operation. Higher values increase
      stability but reduce responsiveness to persistent congestion.
      Example: 2 consecutive breaches ensures congestion is sustained before optimization.
    type: integer
    minimum: 1
  algo:
    description: |
      Channel selection algorithm to use when optimization is triggered.
      - 'rcs' (Radio Channel Selection): Basic channel selection based on utilization measurements
      - 'acs' (Automatic Channel Selection): Advanced algorithm considering interference,
        noise floor, and neighboring AP presence for optimal channel selection
      RCS provides faster decisions while ACS offers more comprehensive analysis.
      Example: Use 'acs' for environments with complex interference patterns.
    type: string
    examples:
    - rcs
    - acs
