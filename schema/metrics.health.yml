  Health monitoring configuration for periodic system health assessment and reporting.
  The health monitoring system performs various connectivity and service checks, then
  reports an overall health score between 0-100 indicating device operational status.
  This enables proactive monitoring of network connectivity, DHCP functionality, and
  DNS resolution capabilities for troubleshooting and maintenance purposes.
type: object
properties:
  interval:
    description: |
      Health check execution and reporting interval in seconds.
      Defines how frequently the system performs all enabled health checks
      and reports the calculated health score to the management system.
      Lower values provide more responsive monitoring but increase system overhead.
      Example: 300 seconds (5 minutes) provides balanced monitoring frequency.
    type: integer
    minimum: 60
  dhcp-local:
    description: |
      Enable probing of local downstream DHCP servers for connectivity verification.
      When enabled, the access point periodically attempts to contact DHCP servers
      on downstream (LAN) interfaces to verify they are responsive and functioning.
      This helps detect issues with local DHCP infrastructure that could impact
      client connectivity and IP address assignment.
      Example: Enable to monitor internal DHCP server health on LAN networks.
    type: boolean
    default: true
  dhcp-remote:
    description: |
      Enable probing of remote upstream DHCP servers for connectivity verification.
      When enabled, the access point attempts to contact DHCP servers on upstream
      (WAN) interfaces to verify external DHCP infrastructure availability.
      This helps detect issues with ISP or upstream network DHCP services that
      could affect the access point's own IP address acquisition and connectivity.
      Example: Enable to monitor upstream ISP DHCP server availability.
    type: boolean
    default: false
  dns-local:
    description: |
      Enable probing of local DNS servers for name resolution verification.
      When enabled, the access point performs DNS queries against local DNS servers
      (typically on downstream interfaces) to verify they are responsive and can
      resolve domain names correctly. This helps detect DNS infrastructure issues
      that could impact client internet connectivity and application functionality.
      Example: Enable to monitor local DNS server health and resolution capability.
    type: boolean
    default: true
  dns-remote:
    description: |
      Enable probing of remote DNS servers for external name resolution verification.
      When enabled, the access point performs DNS queries against external DNS servers
      (typically public DNS servers like 8.8.8.8 or ISP DNS servers) to verify
      internet connectivity and external domain name resolution capability.
      This helps detect upstream connectivity issues that could prevent clients
      from accessing internet resources and web services.
      Example: Enable to monitor external DNS connectivity and internet reachability.
    type: boolean
    default: true
