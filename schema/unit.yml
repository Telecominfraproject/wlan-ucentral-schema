description:
  A device has certain properties that describe its identity and location.
  These properties are described inside this object.
type: object
properties:
  name:
    description: |
      The administrative name of the device used for identification and management purposes.
      This descriptive label appears in management interfaces and system logs.
      It may contain spaces and special characters to provide meaningful context.
      Example: "Building A - Floor 2 - Conference Room AP"
    type: string
  hostname:
    description: |
      The network hostname assigned to the device for DNS and network identification.
      Must follow standard hostname conventions (alphanumeric, hyphens, no spaces).
      If not specified, the device's serial number will be used as the hostname.
      This value appears in DHCP requests, mDNS broadcasts, and system prompts.
      Example: "conference-room-ap-01"
    type: string
    format: hostname
  location:
    description: |
      Physical location or deployment site of the device for asset tracking and maintenance.
      This field helps technicians locate devices for service and troubleshooting.
      It may contain spaces and special characters for detailed location information.
      Example: "Building A, Floor 2, Room 201, Ceiling tile C3"
    type: string
  timezone:
    description: |
      System timezone configuration that determines local time for logs, scheduled tasks, and reports.
      Accepts standard timezone identifiers (e.g., "UTC", "America/New_York") or POSIX TZ strings.
      Proper timezone setting ensures accurate timestamps and correct execution of time-based rules.
      If not specified, the device defaults to UTC.
    type: string
    examples:
    - UTC
    - EST5
    - CET-1CEST,M3.5.0,M10.5.0/3
  leds-active:
    description: |
      Controls the operational state of all LED indicators on the device.
      When set to true (default), LEDs operate normally showing system status.
      When set to false, all LEDs are disabled for environments requiring minimal light emission.
      Useful in hospitality settings, bedrooms, or light-sensitive installations.
    type: boolean
    default: true
  random-password:
    description: |
      Enables automatic generation of a secure random password for the root/admin account.
      When enabled, the device generates a cryptographically strong password at boot
      and reports it to the management gateway for secure storage and retrieval.
      This enhances security by ensuring each device has a unique administrative password.
      Cannot be used together with system-password.
    type: boolean
    default: false
  system-password:
    description: |
      Sets a specific password for the root/admin account on the device.
      The password should be provided in plaintext and will be securely hashed on the device.
      Use this for environments requiring a standardized administrative password.
      For enhanced security, consider using random-password instead.
      Cannot be used together with random-password.
      Example: "MySecureP@ssw0rd!"
    type: string
  beacon-advertisement:
    description:
      The TIP vendor IEs that shall be added to beacons
    type: object
    properties:
      device-name:
        description: |
          Includes the device's administrative name in WiFi beacon frames as a vendor-specific
          Information Element (IE). This allows WiFi scanners and management tools to identify
          the device without authentication. Useful for troubleshooting and site surveys.
        type: boolean
      device-serial:
        description: |
          Includes the device's serial number in WiFi beacon frames as a vendor-specific
          Information Element (IE). This enables automated inventory management and device
          discovery by management systems scanning the wireless environment.
        type: boolean
      network-id:
        description: |
          A provider-defined numeric identifier for the network or venue where the device operates.
          This ID is broadcast in beacon frames to help client devices and management systems
          identify which network group or location the access point belongs to.
          Useful for multi-venue deployments or network segmentation.
          Example: 12345 for "Campus Network A"
        type: integer
