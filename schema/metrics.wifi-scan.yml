  Configure periodic WiFi environment scanning for site surveys and RF 
  analysis. This metric enables automatic scanning of surrounding wireless 
  networks to collect information about neighboring access points, channel 
  utilization, and radio environment conditions. The collected scan data 
  helps with channel optimization, interference analysis, and network planning.
type: object
properties:
  interval:
    description: |
      The scanning interval in seconds that defines how frequently WiFi 
      environment scans are performed. This controls the balance between 
      maintaining current RF awareness and minimizing scanning overhead 
      on the radio interfaces.
      
      Typical values range from 60 seconds (1 minute) for detailed monitoring 
      in dynamic environments to 600 seconds (10 minutes) or more for stable 
      environments. Frequent scanning provides better RF intelligence but may 
      impact client performance during scan periods.
    type: integer
    examples: [60, 120, 300, 600]
  verbose:
    description: |
      Enable collection of detailed capability and operational information 
      from discovered access points. When enabled, the scan results include 
      additional technical details beyond basic network identification.
      
      Verbose information includes:
      - Device capabilities and supported features
      - HT (High Throughput) and VHT (Very High Throughput) operation parameters
      - Channel width and MIMO configuration details
      - Advanced 802.11 feature support
      
      This detailed information is valuable for comprehensive RF analysis 
      and competitive intelligence but increases data volume and processing 
      overhead. Defaults to false.
    type: boolean
    default: false
  information-elements:
    description: |
      Include raw Information Elements (IEs) from beacon and probe response 
      frames in the scan results. Information Elements contain detailed 
      technical parameters and vendor-specific data from each discovered 
      access point.
      
      When enabled, the complete IE data provides the most comprehensive 
      view of neighboring networks, including vendor extensions, advanced 
      features, and non-standard implementations. This is particularly 
      useful for:
      - Deep RF analysis and troubleshooting
      - Vendor identification and feature detection  
      - Security analysis and compliance monitoring
      - Research and development purposes
      
      Note that raw IE data significantly increases the size of scan results 
      and should be used judiciously. Defaults to false.
    type: boolean
    default: false
