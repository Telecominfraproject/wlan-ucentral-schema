  Configure DHCP injection service that enables DHCP traffic forwarding between 
  uplink ports and wireless SSIDs. This service allows wireless clients to receive 
  DHCP responses from upstream DHCP servers by forwarding DHCP requests and responses 
  through selected physical network ports. The service is automatically enabled when 
  SSIDs are configured with "dhcp-inject" in their services array.

      should be used for DHCP traffic forwarding. These ports act as the bridge 
      between wireless SSIDs requesting DHCP injection and upstream DHCP servers.
